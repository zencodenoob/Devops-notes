#These are notes on the basics of git
#There are mainly two types of git workflows - working locally and working remotly
#Using git locally :-

#	git init [Repository] <This command is used to initialize an empty local git repository> 
#	git add .             <Git command used for staging all changes you made in the local repository>
#	git restore FILE      <Git command to unstage changes>
#	git commit            <Git command to commit the changes you made in the local repo>
#	git log               <Git command to view all you commits>
#	git checkout hash     <Git command is used here to go back to a previous commit using its hash id >


#Working with git remotly

# Create ssh key useing command :
		ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "name@email.com"

# Copy and paste the public key to git and run the following command in terminal to verify SSH :
		ssh -T git@github.com

#Git commands for remote work :-

#	git remote add origin SSH-of-repo    <This command is used to set the origin(the repository in github)>
# 	git push -u origin master            <Git command to upload changes to github. -u flag used to ignore history of github repo>
#       git pull origin master               <Git command to download changes from github repository>
