#This note is on intermediate git
#Git remote workflow:- Working with other's repository

#First fork the repository you want to work on.
#Copy the url of the fork and then run the clone command in your terminal

#	git clone URL                   <Downloads the code>
#	git commit -a                   <Git command for staging and commiting in one go>
#	git diff                        <Git command that displays the changes in files in pwd vs staging area>
#	git diff HEAD                   <Displays differences in pwd vs the last commit>
#	git diff --staged HEAD          <Differences b/w staging area and last commit>
#	git diff -FILE                  <Displays changes in the specified file>
#	git diff hash_id1 hash_Id2      <Displays changes b/w commits>
#	git diff master origin/master   <Displays differences b/w local repo and remote repo>

#Branching:

#	git branch			<Displays all branches>
#	git branch BRANCH_NAME		<Creates new branch>
#	git chechkout BRANCH		<Moves HEAD to BRANCH>
#	git branch -m OLD NEW		<Renames old branch to new branch; -m stands for move>
#	git branch -d BRANCH		<Deletes BRANCH>
#	git checkout -b BRANCH		<Creates BRANCH and checkout to it>
#	git merge BRANCH		<Use git merge in master to merge the changes to master>
#	git merge --no-ff		<Turns of fastforward merges and preserves branch commits; will result in a commit in master and then merge>
#	git log --oneline --graph	<Displays log with only one line for each commit and with graph>

#Rebase in git: -

#	git rebase master		<Change the base from which a branch is created>
#	git rebase --abort		<Aborts a rebase incase of conflicts>
#	git rebase --continue		<Continue with rebase after solving rebase conflict>
#	git pull --rebase origin master <Rebase local master to remote master>

#Undo in git:-
#
#	git commit -amend		<Edits previous commit with changes newly staged>
#	git restore HEAD FILE		<Unstage changes in FILE>
